# Audit.EntityFramework

Automatically generates audit logs for Entity Framework operations, supporting both Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core.

This library provides the infrastructure to log interactions with the EF `DbContext`, capturing detailed information about CRUD operations performed on your database.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/thepirat000/Audit.NET/blob/master/src/Audit.EntityFramework) for more information and examples.

See [Documentation](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/extensions/audit-entityframework-core) for detailed guides, examples, and references on how to integrate and use Audit.EntityFramework in your projects.
